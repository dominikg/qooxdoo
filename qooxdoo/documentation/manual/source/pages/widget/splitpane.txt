==== Description====
The most important class (and the class you will use mainly) inside the ''qx.ui.splitpane'' package is the ''Pane''. One can add two widgets (of any type) to it. Besides this two widgets a ''Pane'' also contains a ''Splitter'' between them. By clicking on it (and holding down the mouse button), a ''Slider'' will appear and follow the mouse to indicate where the ''Splitter'''s will be placed when the mouse button is released. Once the mouse button is released the available space inside the ''Pane'' is redivided to both widgets according to the ''Splitter'''s new position.
