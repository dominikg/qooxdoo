====== Label ======

The Label widget is used to display either plain text or rich text with HTML markup.

==== Features ====

  * Auto sizing
  * Ellipsis: If the label does not fit into the widget bounds an ellipsis ("...") is rendered at the end of the label. (Only in text mode)
  * "height for width": If the widget's width is too small to display the text in one line the text is wrapped and a new size hint is calculated. (Only in HTML mode)
  * Configurable fonts, text colors and text alignment


==== Description====

The Label supports two different modes. The text and the HTML mode. The mode can be set by using the ''rich'' property. Which mode to use depends on the required features. If possible the text mode should be preferred because in this mode the text size calculation is faster.
