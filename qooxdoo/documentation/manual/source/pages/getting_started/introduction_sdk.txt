====== Introduction to the SDK ======

Or //"Everything is a library."//

While the [[helloworld|Hello World]] tutorial is geared towards getting you started with your own project, this page walks you through the basic structure of the qooxdoo SDK itself.

There is a page that gives you an overview of the [[framework_structure|physical structure]] of the SDK. As you can see there the SDK has four main components represented through the subdirectories //application//, //component//, //framework// and //tool//. Three of them, //application//, //component// and //framework// contain (either directly or in further subdirectories) qooxdoo applications or libraries that follow the general scheme for a [[application_structure|qooxdoo application]]. In each you will find a //Manifest.json// file which signifies the adherance to the skeleton scheme. They also all contain a //generate.py// script which offers all or a subset of the standard [[.:tool:generator_usage|qooxdoo jobs]] that you can run on a library, like //source//, //build//, //test// or //api//.

The fourth component, //tool//, comprises the [[.:tool:generator|tool chain]] and its various parts. You shouldn't need to worry about that since you interact with the tool chain through the //generate.py// script or one of the tool/bin scripts like //create-application.py//.

In the SDK's root directory there is - besides //readme.txt// and //license.txt// - an //index.html// that gives you an overview over and access to most of the SDK's applications and components. Just be aware (as mentioned on that page) that all of them need a ''generate.py build'' first in their respective directories. Only the Apiviewer for the framework is shipped pre-built with the SDK currently and can be invoked immediately.
