====== Manifest.json ======

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_file|Manifest files]] serve to provide meta information for a library in a structured way. Their syntax is in JSON. They have a more "informal" part (keyed ''info''), which is more interesting for human readers, and a technical part (named ''provides'') that is used in the processing of generator configurations. Here is a brief sample with all the possible keys:

<code javascript>
{
  "info" : 
  {
    "name" : "Custom Application",

    "summary" : "Custom Application",
    "description" : "This is a skeleton for a custom application with qooxdoo.",
    
    "keywords" : ["custom"],
    "homepage" : "http://some.homepage.url/",

    "license" : "SomeLicense",
    "authors" : 
    [
      {
        "name" : "First Author (uid)",
        "email" : "first.author@some.domain"
      }
    ],

    "version" : "trunk",
    "qooxdoo-versions": ["trunk"]
  },
  
  "provides" : 
  {
    "namespace"   : "custom",
    "encoding"    : "utf-8",
    "class"       : "source/class",
    "resource"    : "source/resource",
    "translation" : "source/translation",
    "type"        : "application"
  }
}
</code>

The file paths of the ''class'', ''resource'' and ''translation'' keys are taken to be relative to the directory of the Manifest file. The ''namespace'' attribute can be overridden in the importing config file (in the [[:documentation:1.2:tool:generator_config_ref#library]] key).
