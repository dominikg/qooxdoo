====== How to set the focus to a widget in a window? ======

Here is the solution:

<code javascript>
var win = new qx.ui.window.Window();
var field = new qx.ui.form.TextField;
win.add(field)
...
win.addListener("appear",function() {
  field.focus();
}, win);
this.getRoot().add(win);
win.open();
</code>

We must set the focus in the appear event of the window (before the window is shown).  Otherwise it doesn't work.
