====== Problems with "this" in event handlers ======

How do I ensure that the correct "this" is referred to in an event handler? Say you have an event-handler within a custom widget which looks like this:

<code javascript>
_someHandler : function(e) {
	alert(this);
}
</code>

and then later within the same class definition, register a handler with another class instance:

<code javascript>
var anotherWidget = new AnotherWidget();
anotherWidget.addEventListener("changeSomething", this._someHandler);
</code>

When the handler gets triggered by a "changeSomething" event, the alert of the handler is being called. However, there is a problem in that 'this' now refers to an object of class AnotherWidget and not to the instance of MyWidget. To solve this problem, use:

<code javascript>
anotherWidget.addEventListener("changeSomething", this._handler, this);
</code>
