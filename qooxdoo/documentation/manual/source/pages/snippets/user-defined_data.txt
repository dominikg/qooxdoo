====== User-defined data ======

Storing any arbitrary value in a qooxdoo object.

You can store arbitrary user-defined data in any qooxdoo object using the ''setUserData'' and ''getUserData'' methods. These are guaranteed not to conflict with qooxdoo or javascript properties of the object. Note that as qooxdoo events are derived from ''qx.event.type.Event'' which extends ''qx.core.Object'', you can store user-defined data in events as well.

For example:

<code javascript>
MyObject.setUserData("MyData", "123");
MyObject.debug("MyData = " + MyObject.getUserData("MyData"));
