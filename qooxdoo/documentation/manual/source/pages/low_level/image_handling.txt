====== Image Handling ======

This document tries to give some insights into the low-level features for image handling. This includes the functionality of these classes:

  * ''qx.bom.element.Background'' ([[http://api.qooxdoo.org#qx.bom.element.Background|API]])
  * ''qx.bom.element.Decoration'' ([[http://api.qooxdoo.org#qx.bom.element.Decoration|API]])

Generally there are two common ways to show images in a browser: normal image elements and background images. The ''Decoration'' class supports both of them and automatically selects the type to use for a specific requirement. The ''Background'' class is a simple wrapper around the support for background images. It is mainly some cross-browser magic to fix a few quirks of some of the supported engines.
