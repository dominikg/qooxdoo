====== Unit Testing ======

qooxdoo comes with its own, nicely integrated unit testing environment and the corresponding application called [[http://demo.qooxdoo.org/1.2.x/testrunner|Testrunner]]. While being similar to JSUnit, the solution that ships with the qooxdoo SDK does not require any additional software. 

If you look at the component section of a qooxdoo distribution, you will find the Test Runner tailored to test the functionality of the qooxdoo //framework//. It provides a convenient interface to test classes that have been written to that end. You can run single tests, or a whole suite of them at once.

But the Test Runner framework can be deployed for your //own application//. It provides a GUI, a layer of infrastructure and a certain interface for arbitrary test classes. You can write your own test classes and take advantage of the Test Runner environment.\\
