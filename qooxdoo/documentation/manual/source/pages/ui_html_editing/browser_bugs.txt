====== Browser Bugs ======

===== Gecko =====

  * **Gecko 1.8** //needs// a ''<br>'' tag inside an element with ''contenteditable="true"'', even if the element is empty! If no such element existes, Gecko automatically adds it. These elements can be recognized by the proprietary attribute //_moz_editor_bogus_node//: <html><br></html>''<br _moz_editor_bogus_node="TRUE" _moz_dirty=""/>''
  * **Gecko 1.9** will //always// insert this ''<br>'' tag, if ''contenteditable="true"'' is set. Even if the element contains content! This ''<br>'' tag is removed, as soon as any input is entered by the user: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=119342

  * **Undo/Redo** : it //could// happen that 2 content changes occuring right after another leading Gecko to remove both of these 2 changes in **one** undo step. This is especially important for the undo/redo stacks of the HtmlArea.



===== Internet Explorer =====

  * If you want to use the ''pasteHTML()'' function, you have to select the textrange first using ''select()''.



===== Webkit/Safari =====

  * Setting a background color for text on //collapsed// selection is not working like in Gecko or IE. Instead of setting the background color and allowing the user to type ahead in the new background color (like in Gecko/IE) nothing happens. The current solution in the HtmlArea is to select the word currently under the caret and to set the background color on this selection. Working on a user-selection works as expected.

  * Deleting a block element (e.g. an <p> tag) can cause an element to contain //two// text nodes:<html><br></html>{{:contrib:project:htmlarea:webkit_bug.png|:contrib:project:htmlarea:webkit_bug.png}}<html><br></html>This wrong behavior  can cause problems with selections.
